        <p id="harlem" class = "animated fadeInRight">
            During the early 20th century, African-American poets, musicians, actors, artists <br> and intellectuals moved to Harlem
              in New York City and brought new ideas that <br> shifted the culture forever. From approximately 1918 to the mid 1930s,
              talent began <br> to overflow within this newfound culture of the black community in Harlem, <br> as prominent figures—Langston
              Hughes, Duke Ellington and Billie Holiday, <br>to name a few—pushed art to its limit as a form of expression and
              representation. <br> These are some of the famous African Americans who shaped the influential movement <br> known as
              the Harlem Renaissance.

				<p id = "biography">Born in Topeka, Kansas, Aaron Douglas was a leading figure in the artistic
				and literary movement known as the Harlem Renaissance. He is sometimes referred 
				to as "the father of black American art." Douglas developed an interest in art early on, 
				finding some of his inspiration from his mother's love for painting watercolors.</p>
				<br>
				<p id = "biography">He contributed illustrations the National Urban League's magazine, 
				and to The Crisis, put out by the National Association for the Advancement Colored People. 
				Douglas created powerful images of African-American life and struggles, and won awards 
				for the work he created for these publications, ultimately receiving a commission to

			<br>
				<p id = "biography">In the 1930s, Lois Mailou Jones' art reflected the influences of African
				traditions, and she designed African-style masks and in 1938 painted Les Fétiches, 
				which depicts masks in five distinct, ethnic styles. During a year in Paris, 
				she produced landscapes and figure studies, and African influences reemerged in her art 
				in the late 1960s and early 1970s, particularly after two tours of Africa.</p>
				<br>
				<p id = "biography">In 1953 Jones married the artist Louis Vergniaud Pierre-Noël of Haiti, 
				and she came to know many of that nation’s artists. From this time she painted portraits 
				and landscapes in brighter colours and with a more expressionistic style than she had previously 
				employed. Her paintings became bold and abstract, and African design elements began to dominate.</p>

				<p id = "biography"> In 1923, Savage applied to a special summer program to study art in France, 
				but was rejected because of her race. She took the rejection as a call to action, 
				and sent letters to the local media about the program selection committee's 
				discriminatory practices. Savage's story made headlines in many newspapers, although 
				it wasn't enough to change the group's decision. One committee member, Herman MacNeil, 
				regretted the ruling and invited Savage to further hone her craft at his Long Island studio.</p>
				<br>
				<p id = "biography">Savage soon started to make a name for herself as a portrait sculptor. 
				Her works from this time include busts of such prominent African Americans as W. E. B. 
				Du Bois and Marcus Garvey. Savage was considered to be one of the leading artists of the 
				Harlem Renaissance.</p>

		such as Bubber Miley, who used a plunger to make the "wa-wa" sound, and Joe Nanton, who gave the world his trombone "growl." 
		At various times, his ensemble included the trumpeter Cootie Williams, cornetist Rex Stewart and alto saxophonist Johnny Hodges. 
		Ellington made hundreds of recordings with his bands, appeared in films and on radio, and toured Europe on two occasions in the 1930s.</p>
